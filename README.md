# DscLdbExtr (Discord LevelDB Extractor)
A tool to extract tokens from .ldb files

## How does it work?

Simply drag and drop your .ldb files to the program and it'll spit out the tokens it found.

## Why is one layer changing color when I drop the files?
Green Blink | Red Blink
------------ | ------------ |
Token is already on the list | No token found |


##### I can't guarantee the program's functionality. Discord may change the .ldb file's structure at any moment, making the program nonfunctional.

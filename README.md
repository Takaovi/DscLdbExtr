# DscLdbExtr (Discord LevelDB Extractor)
A tool to extract tokens from Discord's .ldb files

## How does it work?

Simply drag and drop your .ldb files to the program and it'll spit out the tokens it found.

## Why is one layer changing color when I drop the files?
Green Blink | Red Blink
------------ | ------------ |
Token is already on the list | No token found |

## The program doesn't work!

Not to worry, you can get the token manually too.
1. Open the .ldb file in a text editor such as notepad++.
2. Look for the last line, your token should be between the first equation marks.

##### I can't guarantee the program's functionality. Discord may change the .ldb file's structure at any moment.
